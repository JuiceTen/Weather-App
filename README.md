# Weather-App

This weather app is designed so that if you type in a city you will be returned with the current weather as well as a 5-day forcast.

The temperature is displayed in Faranheit and will display the humidity windpeed and UV index for the current day.

The 5-day forecast shows the expected temperature and humidity as well as an icon to display whether it will be sunny/cloudy/raining/snowing.

When the user clicks on their search history it will display their previous search's current weather and forecast. 

The website will also be responsive and should look fine on both mobile and larger devices
